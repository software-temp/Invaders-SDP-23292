Team introduction (goal, vision, list of roles)

Our goal is to make sounds easily recognizable regarding different events that can happen throughout the games. Moreover, it should fit into the vibe of the game so that the player can be completely immersed while playing it.

List of roles:

- Leader : Lucie Ribero
- Git head : Mathys Rageade
- Development team: Leo Sorrentino, Mattéo Revest, Anne-Amélie Nassiet-Combe, Hing-Thanh Truong

Team requirements (overall project)
Creating sound assets and background music fitting the game event and atmosphere and other upcoming functions.
Detailed requirement (5)
- Menu music : a looped music that plays for as long as the player stays on the menu. It must be different from the 
background music and be like a kind of appealing sound giving envy to play.
- Background music fitting for each level : An 8 bit-music to stay in the game atmosphere, genre fitting and different 
for each level to match the progression.
- End of the level (win or lose) : a short sound emphasizing the death or the win of the player. It has to be 
recognizable especially for the loss.
- Sound effect (shooting, buttons and alien appearance) : some background sound not too loud nor too intrusive to 
make the experience more appealing to create atmosphere but not chaos.
- Damage taken : just a short and loud enough sound explaining that the player has taken damage to bring his 
attention to the remaining hp if he didn’t see the projectiles hit him

Dependencies on other team (3)
- Music depending on the level reached : since other teams are creating levels we have to match the sound with the 
pace or the background of said level
- Achievements reached and currency sound : same as when taking damage, just a sound alert signaling that the player 
has reached an achievement or used his money
- Sound when inviting an another player (multiplayer mode) : more of an atmosphere sound to describe the fact that 
another player is joining the game before it starts
